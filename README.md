## Features

- **Stream Processing**: Handle real-time data streams with built-in operators.
- **Event-Driven Design**: React to events and triggers with customizable callbacks.
- **Scalable Pipelines**: Easily build and scale data processing pipelines.
- **Extensible API**: Plug in your own modules and operators.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Manage exceptions and recover gracefully.
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed and community-driven.

## Installation

You can install Fluxion using pip:

```bash
pip install fluxion
```

Or clone the repository for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedatk/fluxion.git
cd fluxion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example to get started:

```python
import fluxion

# Define your data stream
stream = fluxion.Stream([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Apply a transformation
stream = stream.map(lambda x: x * 2)

# Output the results
for item in stream:
    print(item)
```

---

## Usage

Fluxion provides intuitive classes for building pipelines:

```python
from fluxion import Stream, Pipeline

# Create a stream from a list
data = Stream([10, 20, 30])

# Build a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_step(lambda x: x + 1)
pipeline.add_step(lambda x: x * 5)

# Run the pipeline
results = pipeline.run(data)
print(list(results))  # Output: [55, 105, 155]
```

## Configuration

Fluxion is highly configurable via environment variables and configuration files. See `config.yaml` for options like:

- Logging level
- Parallelism
- Custom operators

---

## Architecture

Fluxion consists of several main components:

- **Stream**: Represents a sequence of data items.
- **Pipeline**: Chains together transformations and operations.
- **Operator**: Custom logic applied to streams.
- **Scheduler**: Manages execution and parallelism.

The design allows for easy extension and integration with other Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas).
